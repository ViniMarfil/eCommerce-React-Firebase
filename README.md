# eCommerce template with React, Firebase and Tailwind

## About
This is a project that I made from scratch to learn and test my knowledge about those three features.

## Features
1. Fully responsive site that works either with a mobile device or with a desktop
2. User sign and log in, either through the app, or through Google Authenticate
3. Dark mode and light mode, based on the user's preference
4. Use of local storage for the cart items
5. use of firebase for the cart wishlist

Not all features were implemented, there's some buttons that are visual only and the search engine does not work, since they were not the scope of this project.

## Technologies used
1. React for the frontend
2. Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service
3. Tailwind for the faster and easier styling
4. Yarn as the package manager
5. Fake Store API for easier testing. https://fakestoreapi.com/

## Things that I would improve about this project
### 1. Using a Meta Framework
Any would make the app faster and the development of the backend part much easier. To be fair, I already have the basics of the Next.js and I could've used it, but since Next.js 13 has just been announced - with a complete different way of using it - and I already had enough in my plate, I decided to not use it.

### 2. Using TypeScript
Same as the above, would make the development easier (and its not THAT hard to implement) but I already had enough things going on. If I could the first thing I would do is say goodbye to JavaScript.

### 3. Creating more reusable Styled Components
I had to copy and paste WAY too many buttons, breaking the DRY principle and making the development harder. I could've made a set of beautiful cards, buttons and reutilized then over the course of the project. 

### 4. Learning more about the Firebase
I don't think I implemented the Firebase API in a good way, a meta framework would help, but I had a LOT of trouble with racing conditions. 

### 5. Making the project structure more organized
The project structure is ugly. I know. I tested a bunch of stuff, and right know its so convoluted that it makes the project way more confusing than it should be.

## Why I am not going to improve _this_ project with the ideas above
The best way to learn about something is doing it. I would not have learned how good TypeScript is at protecting myself from using the wrong props, I would not have learned how MUCH reusing styled components make the coding more fun or how important is a good and organized project structure.

All those ugly mistakes helped me learn about them. I could improve my project, but them I would find more mistakes, then list them again... and then repeat the same cycle. So instead, I am going to save this project as a _snapshot_ of my career, as a reminder for my future self, a reminder about how much I've grown as a developer.
