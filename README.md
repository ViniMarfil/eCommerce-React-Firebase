# eCommerce template with React, Firebase and Tailwind

## About
This is a project that I made from scratch to learn and test my knowledge about those three features.

## Features
1. Fully responsive site that works either with a mobile device or with a desktop
2. User sign and log in, either through the app, or through Google Authenticate
3. Dark mode and light mode, based on the user's preference
4. Use of local storage for the cart items
5. use of firebase for the cart wishlist

Not all features were implemented, there's some buttons that are visual only and the search engine does not work, since they were not the scope of this project.

## Technologies used
1. React for the frontend
2. Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service
3. Tailwind for the faster and easier styling
4. Yarn as the package manager

## What I am proud of and what should I have done instead

## Installing
Simply download or clone the project, then use `yarn install` to install the dependencies then `yarn start` to start the project.
